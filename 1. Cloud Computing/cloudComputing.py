#! What is Cloud Computing?
#  Cloud computing is the ON-DEMAND delivery of computer power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
# Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
# You can provision, right type and size of resources that cater your needs.
# You can access the resources that you need whenever you need to
# It is a easier method of accessing all the services that are needed.

#* AWS owns and maintains these.

#? DropBox: Cloud storage services
#  Originally built on AWS

#? Netflix: Built on AWS
#  Video on demand

#! Models of the cloud
# Private cloud: Cloud services used by a single organization, that cater specific business needs, completely controlled.

# Pulic Cloud: MS Azure, Goolgle cloud, and AWS

# Hybrid Cloud: keep some on land, and some on Cloud.


#! 5 characteristics of Cloud computing
#   On Demand self service: we can use resource and use them without having to interact with a person from the service provider and discuss.

#   Broad network access: the resources available over the network can be access by clients or users from various platforms.

#   Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Everyone or most of us share the same infrastructure and application resources with security and privacy.

#   Rapid elasticity anf scalability: Use whenever needed, if demand is high use more if not dispose what you don't need instantly.

#   Measured service: you only pay for what you use.

#! Advantages of Cloud Computing
# Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
#     don't purchase hardware, rent it so you only have to pay when you need it.
#     reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
# As AWS scales the prices will go down.
# No need to guess the capacity
# Increase speed and agility
# No spending of money running and maintaining data centers physically(in house)
# By using AWs you can go world wide within a short span of time

#! Problems solved by Cloud?
# Flexibility, Cost-Effectiveness, Scalability, Elasticity, High-availability and fault-tolerance, Agility, you can develop software applications, test and launch rapidly.


#! Types of Cloud Computing

#* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
#  Provides building blocks for Cloud IT. provides netoworking, computers, data storage. This provides too much flexibility, it is similar to on-premise IT.

# Example:  Buying pre-packed ingredients like fresh pasta and sauce made by someone else that you use to cook at home. 

#* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
#  Here you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
#  Only focus on deployment and management of your application.

# Example: Order takeout or delivery where your meal is prepared for you and you don’t have to worry about the ingredients or how you’ll cook it, but you have to worry about where you’ll eat, the utensils, and cleaning up after your meal.

#* Software as a Service (SaaS)
# It is a completed product which is ran and managed by the IT service provider.

# Example: Telling your personal chef the exact meal you want. They prepare everything ahead of time for you so that all you have to do is show up and eat.

# We need to manage
#* The provider manages
