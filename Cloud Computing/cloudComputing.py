#! What is Cloud Computing?
#  Cloud computing is the ON-DEMAND delivery of computer power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
# Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
# You can provision, right type and size of resources that cater your needs.
# You can access the resources that you need whenever you need to
# It is a easier method of accessing all the services that are needed.

#* AWS owns and maintains these.

#? DropBox: Cloud storage services
#  Originally built on AWS

#? Netflix: Built on AWS
#  Video on demand

#! Models of the cloud
# Private cloud: Cloud services used by a single organization, that cater specific business needs, completely controlled.

# Pulic Cloud: MS Azure, Goolgle cloud, and AWS

# Hybrid Cloud: keep some on land, and some on Cloud.


#! 5 characteristics of Cloud computing
#   On Demand self service: we can use resource and use them without having to interact with a person from the service provider and discuss.

#   Broad network access: the resources available over the network can be access by clients or users from various platforms.

#   Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Everyone or most of us share the same infrastructure and application resources with security and privacy.

#   Rapid elasticity anf scalability: Use whenever needed, if demand is high use more if not dispose what you don't need instantly.

#   Measured service: you only pay for what you use.

#! Advantages of Cloud Computing
# Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
#     don't purchase hardware, rent it so you only have to pay when you need it.
#     reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
# As AWS scales the prices will go down.
# No need to guess the capacity
# Increase speed and agility
# No spending of money running and maintaining data centers physically(in house)
# By using AWs you can go world wide within a short span of time

#! Problems solved by Cloud?
# Flexibility, Cost-Effectiveness, Scalability, Elasticity, High-availability and fault-tolerance, Agility, you can develop software applications, test and launch rapidly.
